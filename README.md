Feel free to adjust or expand upon this description to better fit your project's features and goals!

Assets used in the project.
<br>
Sample: color, images, svg etc.

<br>

<a id="Components"></a>
# Components

Components Folder containing base components in the project.
<br>
Sample: ToastMessage etc.

<br>

<a id="Helpers"></a>
# Helpers

Helpers Folder containing base functions in the project.
<br>
Sample: storage process, redux management from out of components etc.

<br>

<a id="Hooks"></a>
# Hooks
Hooks Folder containing base hooks in the project.
<br>
Sample: useTheme etc.

<br>

<a id="Modules"></a>
# Modules
The Modules is a special folder. It allows you to manage your application more easily by dividing it into modules according to business logic.

 Modules have their own files inside;

- Component (CustomButton, CustomLayout etc.)
- Redux (Actions, Reducers, Store etc.)
- Utils (Type etc. )
- API (API request, routes)
- Services

<br>

In this way, it provides a simpler and easier development process by searching the codes related to the Module only in that folder.
